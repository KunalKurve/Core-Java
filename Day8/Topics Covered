1. Multithreading
Creating a Thread class and implementing it in 2 ways
- extending Thread class
- implementing Runnable interface
- third way - out of syllabus (using Anonymous Classes)


micro assignment: using Lambda, as Runnable is a functional interface



2. Synchronization
run method cannot be synchronised
methods called inside run method can be sync.

when needed : when two threads works on the same method then Sync. them by this Thread 1 is completely executed first then thread 2.
