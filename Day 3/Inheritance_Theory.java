/*
A. Inheritance:
- We use it to implement polymorphism. It is important to reduce redundency and to make a universal structure of output for the every method.
- It is used when methods have different behaviour.
- Generally the 1st base class is abstract to support polymorphism.


1. Abstract Class:
- To make a method abstract, me define it using (); 
- We can't create object of a abstract class
- If there is any abstract method, the class becomes abstract.
